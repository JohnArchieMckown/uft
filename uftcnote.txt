Sender Initiated File Transfer / Universal File Transfer 

If you can see this part of the message, 
then either you're NOT using a MIME-capable mail reader 
or you're somehow viewing part zero (normally hidden and not interesting). 

Following this part you should find two others: 
a metafile listing attributes of the file being sent, 
and then the file itself (usually BASE 64 encoded).
