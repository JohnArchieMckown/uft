uft-1.9/README                                               <plaintext>

This is the README file for POSIX UFT.
For more information,  see the HTML files in the "doc" directory
or find the same content on the web at ...

	http://www.casita.net/pub/uft/

The usual sequence of steps to build UFT on a POSIX system is ...

	./configure
	make
	make install
	make clean

The only option 'configure' takes is "--prefix".

For Solaris, if 'make' fails, try

    cc -lnsl -lsocket -o sf uftc.o tcpopen.o getline.o netline.o putline.o

in this directory.

Feel free to use $(CC) and other more orthodox methods in the makefile.
I will eventually clean that up.   Feel free to contribute improvements!

"The numbers are all wrong".   The response code numbers have been
hastily slapped into the code and may change.   But PLEASE NOTE that
one significant aspect of UFT is that the response numbers are UNIQUE.
